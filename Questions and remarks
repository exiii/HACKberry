In order to create the EXIII hand :

- We have to print 3D parts : 
Those files can be found inside this github or there : 
You can download STEP files from the following links.
右手用部品 Right hand

As of 02/09/2017, the "big file", wether in STP ou STL version seems to show differences with the github separate pieces. 
There were 2 pieces missing (gears for the finger).
We (Crealab, France) have some mechanical improvements to submit, we will send them via github and then update the big files if modifications are OK
We might need modification rights to do so.
The names of the folders in "hardware/3D" are not clear. Are them even in use beside STL/HACKberry_STL_v1 ?

- We have to buy other components.
Please only use the file on gdoc, as it seems more up-to-date than the other .xlsx. Can you delete the other link that is visible on this page :
http://exiii-hackberry.com/dw/doku.php?id=how_to_order and also delete and replace it on github with a link to the gdoc ? (but you might want to check if gdoc is complete)
Also, beside France, it could be interesting to create 1 page for each country.

- We have to buy PCBS. Tutorial here : https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lNPcouGmjLMe7-bAQ6hxlp5movhy_fizSsHiVVOBsjk/edit
Tried from seeedstudio, the 02/09/2017, everything worked fine, delivery worldwide, prices are low.
But it might be interesting to separate the PCB procedure from the 3D printing.
Also, looks that there are tons of files in the github that are useless or might be archived.

I also have improvement to submit concerning the assembly. 
- I saw some steps that are not in the right order
- If we set positions of the servo at the limit (mechanical stop) during mouting, could we use simple limits in the Arduino program and forget about the calibration ?

This file has to be deleted in the github : ~$HACKberry_BOM_v1.xlsx

Could it be interesting to rename files that concern right hand ..."_right", as all pieces for left hand have "_left" at the end ?
Seems more coherent to me.

Wouldn't it be better to just redirect from the website to the github, delete ressources from the website and put everything (tutorials, 3D files, links to gdocs, assembly procedure..., software) in the github ?
Because all ressources are here, somewhere, but we have to travel between a not very intuitive website, with some files up to date, others not, sometimes redirecting here and there.

Thanks
Yours
